# Azure-AI-Services
C# files and extensive .md notes for Azure AI Services implementation in the Microsoft AI Skills Challenge august 2023.

## Main goals
The challenge consisted of a series of explanations about the AI services available in Azure and how they work. In addition to this, each block/service had a **testing laboratory** in a remote VM granted by Microsoft Learn. Every block lasted approximately 1 hour(about 16 to 18 hours in total).
These labs explained step by step how to use these Azure AI Services with C# or Python (in my case, C#). The key steps were: authenticating into Azure from our program, creating REST API calls to the service, and handling the files returned by the AI service, typically in JSON format, audio files, or images.
